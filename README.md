# Lobby Tic-Tac-Toe

This application is for my final project for 67-328: Mobile to Cloud: Buidlding Distributed Applications. 

With this app, users can either log in or create a new account. After successfully doing so, users will be then placed into a lobby where they can see other online users. There will be a list of online users, and each user will be colored either green or orange. Green corresponds to a user that is just hanging out in a lobby and orange corresponds to a user that is currently playing a game with someone else. Inside the lobby, users can either chat with everyone else in the lobby or click on another user's name to send them an invitation to play. If a user accepts that invitation, then the game of tic-tac-toe will be initiaed between the two users.
